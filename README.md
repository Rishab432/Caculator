# Calculator
### BIG RED ALERT: THIS IS THE COMPLETED VERSION, YES THERE MAY BE ISSUES... HAVE FUN!
### IF THERE ARE ISSUES PLEASE REPORT THEM IN THE ISSUES PART, I THINK
A **PEDMSA+LTR+IO** calculator with a simple pygame GUI.

### Some Notes For The Tool:
- Brackets are included and work so long as all are matched properly, there must be an expression inside the bracket otherwise there will be an error.
- The calculator follows a PEDMSA+LTR+IO processing rule meaning that division is checked before subtraction and subtraction is checked before addition, it still goes left-to-right and inside-out so no need to worry about that.
- Using exponents: to do a power of a power you must specify whether it is (x^y)^x or x^(y^z) as LTR is used; if you wish to do a square root please convert the number to a fractional exponent.
- Turns long numbers (greater than 11 characters in length, including the dot for decimals) into scientific notation.
- Second page with more operators.
- // and % operators for cooler division.
- Trigonometry functions and logarithim with base e.
- A +/- button to change the value from positive to negative and vica-versa.
- Fraction solution option (shows the values as a fraction if there is a '/' symbol in the equation).
