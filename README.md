# Caculator
A **PEDMSA+LTR+IO** calculator with a simple pygame GUI.

### Some Notes For The Tool:
- Brackets are included and work so long as all are matched properly, there must be an expression inside the bracket otherwise there will be an error.
- The calculator follows a PEDMSA+LTR+IO processing rule meaning that division is checked before subtraction and subtraction is checked before addition, it still goes left-to-right and inside-out so no need to worry about that.
- Using exponents, to do a power of a power you must specify whether it is (x^y)^x or x^(y^z) as LTR is used.
### Possible Updates:
- Add a second page so that the user can access more operators
- Add // and % operators for cooler division.
- Add trigonometry functions, maybe logarithim too.
- Add a +/- button to change the value from positive to negative and vica-versa.
- Add `from fractions import Fraction` to give a fraction solution option.
- Make a cleaner interface.
- Make it into a crappy phone with calendar, calculator, notes, clock and more applications!!
